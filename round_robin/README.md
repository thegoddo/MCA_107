# Round Robin Algorithms

Give every process equal time and change between different processes at constat time quantum

| Process | Burst Time | Waiting Time | Turnaround Time |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1       | 5          | 9            | 14              |
| 2       | 3          | 8            | 11              |
| 3       | 9          | 10           | 19              |
| 4       | 2          | 6            | 8               |

**Average Waiting Time: 8.25**

**Average Turnaround Time: 13.00**
